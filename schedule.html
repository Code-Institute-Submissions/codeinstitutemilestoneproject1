            <h4>Our Classes</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>Our sessions are split into 4 main groups: </p> 
            <ul>
                <li>Beginners</li>
                <li>Advanced</li>
                <li>Mixed Free Fencing</li>
                <li>Private Lessons</li>
            </ul>
                <p>The beginners classes further split into 
                childern's and Teens/ Adults classes. Our advanced class admits students of all ages and fencers need a recommendation from one of our coaches to join the advance class. </p>
                All new members are asked to attend a 30 minute one-on-one intro session prior to their first class in order to get an assessment of prior experience level. </p>
                <br>
            <p>All of our classes are 2 hours long, with the exception of the Children's Beginner sesssion, which is 1 1/2 hrs long. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Beginner Teen/Adult and Mixed Advance classes are split into a 5 minute warmup, followed by 30 minutes of conditioning and footwork and the 25 minutes of bladework before breaking into 
                    free fencing for the last hour of the class. </li>
                <li>Beginners youth (ages 6-12) classes are split into a 5 minute warm-up, 25 minute conditioning and footwork, 20 minute bladework and free fencing for the remaining 40 minutes of class.</li>
                <li>Our Friday Free Fencing sessions are open to members of all ages and experience levels. Unlike the other classes during the week, Free Fencing sessions are completely open 
                    to fencing. There is no group warm-up, though all fencers are advised to do their own short warm-up prior to taking to the piste. 
                    The full 2 hour class is dedicated to fencing on piste, with Private Lessons also available.</li>
                <li>Private lessons are not required for our students, but they are advised for those who wish to seriously compete at a national level. </li>
                <li>Private lessons are available every day during the free fencing segment of the class, and last 20 minutes. Private lessons are separate from the regular classes,
                    and such are priced separately. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The club provides gear for all beginner members to make use of. It is required for fencers who wish to be in the advanced class to have their own full set of gear.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>On the 13th of March, Coach Park is hosting a special Foil Camp. 
                    It will be held from 10am- 4pm. There will be an hour lunch break from 12-1pm. 
                    There are a limited number of spots, so be sure to sign up soon! 
                    Each spot is 250 per fencer. </li>
                <li>The Annual Spring Break Camp is now open for sign-ups. It will run for 1 week, from the 15th to the 19th of March.
                    It is open to all weapons and experience levels. The sessions will run daily from 10am-4pm, with an hour break from 12-1pm. 
                    During this week, all classes will still be held at their normal times.
                    The club will provide water and a camp t-shirt (so be sure to specify size when signing up).
                    Cost for the week is 1000 per fencer. </li>
                <li>The summer t-shirt design competition will open shortly. Every year, we host a 2 week pre-nationals training camp with guest coaches.
                    As a part of the camp, we provide t-shirts, and this year we will be holding a small competition to determine the design of the shirts. 
                    Submit any designs either in person before class or by email before the 30th of March for consideration. All members are encouraged to 
                    submit a design. The only requirements are that they are fencing related and they include the club colours. </li>

<!-- Ran into a problem with the sliding photos and the evetns and compeitions bit at the bottom. The bit at the bottom tried to be taken from the love running project, directly 
and then altered, but it was better in the end to delete that and write in my own things for the html side. Did keep the general format of the css part for that though. 
Also had a brief problem where the love running code part altered the social media footer. Fixed it by getting rid of the love running html part.
Found the correct carousel part on bootsrtap and added that in. Fixed the sliding images. Had a slight issue with the text on the pictures not being visible, so had to add 
a background colour- used rgba to make it semi-transparent. also had to change the colour of the text to fit the new colour better. used w3school to get rgba color code.
Carousel picture text only shows up in tablet (ipad only) and desktop- not mobile size. Fized by getting rid of the "d-none and d-md-block class". Realised this 
problem would have been solved faster if I had just read all of the bootstrap info.
Also nav bar doesn't show in any size smaller than desktop. fixed by adding a toggler from bootstrap.
home menu button briefly had a dark grey box around it. somehow fixed itself- not sure how or when, but it's gone.
only slight problem now is the picture carousel is really big,in desktop. Not really sure this can be change though?-->
