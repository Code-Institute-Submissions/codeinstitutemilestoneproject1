            <h4>Our Club</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Excalibur Fencing Club was founded in 2007, by Coach Lee. What started as a small foil-only fencing school with only 13 initial members has grown into 
a highly rated club with over 50 active members, stretching across all weapons, ages and experience levels. 
The club motto- Determination Percerverance and Victory- demonstrates our club's dedication to the training and advancement of the next generation of 
young fencers and potential Olympic athletes. We are a club that takes training seriously, but also recognise that fencing is a recreational sport, not only professional. 
Our coaches bring years of experience on the piste to their coaching methods and they all have Level 3 coaching certificates in all three weapons.

The team aspect of our members is important to our club. All fencers who compete for our club recieve an iron-on badge to adhere to their fencing uniform 
to show that they are a member of Team Excalibur. All out of town competitions are attended by all coaches, and we encourage any members who can attend, to come and support 
those fencing. On such occasions, the school will be closed for the weekend.

            <h4>Our Coaches</h4>
            <hr>
            <ul>
                <li>Coach Lee- The club's main fencing coach. He used to compete internationally in foil during the 90s, before beginning coaching in the early 2000s. 
                    Coach Lee began coaching within schools before branching out and opening this school. He remains the head coach of the club, and leads all of the advanced sessions.</li>
                <li>Coach Smith- The club's main epee coach. He used to compete at a high national level in epee, before retiring from competitions to focus on training the next generation of 
                    epee fencers 6 years ago. He has been with our school since 2019.</li>
                <li>Coach Davis- The club's main sabre coach. He used to compete internationally in sabre. Following an injury in 2014, he decided to turn to coaching, and gave international 
                    competitions a backseat. Coach Davis is also the in-house armourer. He maintains all of the club weapons, and will fix members'weapons in advance of tournaments. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>All of our coaches are qualified to train each weapon, though they all have their own particular speciality.</p>
