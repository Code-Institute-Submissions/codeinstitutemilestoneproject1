            <ul>
                <li>Foil- One of the three fencing swords. A light weapon in which points are scored though stabbing motions. On the tip of each foil is a blunt tip that depresses when 
                    it makes contact with an opponent's body. Only hits made to an opponent's torso, and that land on the lame are considered to be valid hits in foil.
                    Hits to any other part of the body will be considered off-target, and will not award the player a point. Foil is also subject to "right of way" rules.</li>
                <li>Epee- One of the three fencing swords. Slighly heavier han foil, points in epee are also scored with a stabbing motion. The main difference between the weapons is the 
                    available target area. In epee, any part of the opponent's body is valid. Due to the entire body being a target, epee fencers do not wear lames. Furthermore,
                    simultaneious points can be called, in which both of the fencers score a point. This is unique to this weapon alone. </li>
                <li>Sabre- One of the three fencing swords. In sabre, points are scored by making slashing motions, and the entire blade, not just the tip, is conductive. Due to this, points
                    can be scored  with the lightest contact between the blade and the lame. The valid sabre target is from the head to the waist, with the arms included in the target area.
                    Like foil, this weapon has right of way rules, though it is usually fenced at a far faster speed. </li>
                <li>Lame- A light conductive jacket that is worn over the usual fencing whites. It is worn only for fencing foil and sabre, and the length of the sleeve varies depending on the weapon.
                    A foil lame will have no sleeves, while a sabre lame has full-length sleeves. </li>
                <li>Piste- The area on which fencers conduct matches. An average piste has a width of 1.5 meters and is 14 meters long. The materials can vary. 
                    Most competition pistes are either made of metal or conductive rubber. </li>
                <li>Poule- During competitions, all of the fencers of a certain weapon are split into a number off smaller groups, in which each fencer fights every other fencer in the group.
                    There are usually 2 rounds of poule per competition, before splitting off into direct elimination matches based on fencer rankings that are tabulated from 
                    the results of the poules.</li>
                <li>Direct Elimination- In comeptitions, after the poules, the fencers are ranked and then placed into a table of 128 or 64 (depending on the number of competitors- the table can go as large as 256). 
                    In large competitions, only a certain number of the top fencers will advance from poules into the Direct Elimination rounds to fence off for medals.</li>
                <li>Bout- The individual rounds of fencing. Usually split into 3 minutes, with 5 points needing to be scored during that time. This may vary based on the match. 
                    Poule matches are on round of 3 minutes to 5 points, while Direct Elimination matches are 3 rounds of 3 minutes in which a fencer must score a total of 15 points.</li>
                <li>En Garde, Pret, Allez- Signals the start of the match. Fencers are not permitted to begin fencing prior to "Allez". Doing so may result in a warning or yellow card from the referee.</li>
                <li>FIE- (Federation Internationale d'Escrime) The International Fencing Federation is the global governing body of Olympic fencing.  </li>
            </ul>

<!-- Ran into a problem with the sliding photos and the evetns and compeitions bit at the bottom. The bit at the bottom tried to be taken from the love running project, directly 
and then altered, but it was better in the end to delete that and write in my own things for the html side. Did keep the general format of the css part for that though. 
Also had a brief problem where the love running code part altered the social media footer. Fixed it by getting rid of the love running html part.
Found the correct carousel part on bootsrtap and added that in. Fixed the sliding images. Had a slight issue with the text on the pictures not being visible, so had to add 
a background colour- used rgba to make it semi-transparent. also had to change the colour of the text to fit the new colour better. used w3school to get rgba color code.
Carousel picture text only shows up in tablet (ipad only) and desktop- not mobile size. Fized by getting rid of the "d-none and d-md-block class". Realised this 
problem would have been solved faster if I had just read all of the bootstrap info.
Also nav bar doesn't show in any size smaller than desktop. fixed by adding a toggler from bootstrap.
home menu button briefly had a dark grey box around it. somehow fixed itself- not sure how or when, but it's gone.
only slight problem now is the picture carousel is really big,in desktop. Not really sure this can be change though?-->
