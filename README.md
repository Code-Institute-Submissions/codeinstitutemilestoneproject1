## The Project- Purpose

The purpose of the website is to provide an online base for the Excalibur Fencing Club to promote itself- both by providing information for users seeking information about the club, and for users who are already familiar with the club (eg. current club members, or family members) to find out new information about upcoming events or competitions. 

## Wireframe Designs
The Wireframe designs were created in a notebook using a pencil, and the following images are photos taken from the notebook. As they are handwritten, some of the writing may not be fully legible to all readers. To combat this, I have added a typed description of all pages below the image. PLease refer to those if needed.
